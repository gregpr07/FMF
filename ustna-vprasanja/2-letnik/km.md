## Newtonian Mechanics

-   Summarize the Newtonian dynamics of a single particle.

-   Summarize the Newtonian dynamics for a system of $N$ particles with
    masses $m_1, m_2, \dots, m_N$ and position vectors
    $\bm{r}_1, \bm{r}_2, \dots, \bm{r}_{N}$.

-   Describe the necessary modifications for Newton's laws to hold in
    non-inertial systems.

## Lagrangian Mechanics

-   Explain the role of constraints and generalized coordinates in
    Lagrangian mechanics.

-   Explain virtual displacements and d'Alembert's principle.

-   Derive the Euler-Lagrange equations from d'Alembert's principle.

-   What is the principle of least action? Use the least action
    principle to derive the Euler-Lagrange equations.

-   What is the definition of a conserved quantity in Lagrangian
    mechanics? What is a continuous symmetry of the Lagrangian function?
    Give examples of each. State and prove (the simple version of)
    Noether's theorem, and provide examples of its application.

-   Explain the basics of the Lagrangian formalism for a continuous
    body. Include a derivation of the Lagrange equations for a
    one-dimensional continuous body.

## Central Forces

-   What is the one-body central force problem? Discuss the problem's
    solution in both Newtonian and Lagrangian mechanics, making sure to
    explain the role of conserved quantities. What is the orbit
    equation? Discuss.

-   Discuss two-body central force problem. Explain how the problem is
    solved in both Newtonian and Lagrangian mechanics. Be sure to
    explain the role of conserved quantities in reducing the two-body
    problem to an equivalent one-body problem.

-   What is the Kepler problem? Discuss the relationship between the
    Kepler problem and the orbit equation. Solve the orbit equation, and
    discuss its implications for the orbits of planets. State and derive
    Kepler's laws of planetary motion.

-   What is the Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector and how is it derived? Discuss
    the role of the LRL vector in solving the orbit equation.

## Motion of Rigid Bodies

-   Explain how the Euler angles are used to encode the position and
    kinematics of a rotating rigid body.

-   Provide a thorough treatment of the kinematics of a rigid body with
    on fixed point. Be sure to mention angular velocity, the inertia
    tensor, angular momentum, and the Euler equations.

-   Discuss and analytically solve the equations of motion for a
    symmetric free top, then discuss the stability an asymmetric free
    top using a perturbation approach.

-   Analyze the basic dynamics of a heavy symmetric top with Lagrangian
    mechanics. Be sure to discuss the role of conserved quantities in
    simplifying the solution process. Discuss the conditions for uniform
    precession and a sleeping top.

## Small Oscillations

-   Discuss the eigenfrequencies and normal modes of small oscillations
    about an equilibrium position in a system with $N$ degrees of
    freedom.

-   What are normal coordinates and how are they relevant to small
    oscillations?

## Hamiltonian Mechanics

-   Give an overview of the Hamiltonian formulation of mechanics. Be
    sure to discuss the relationship between the Lagrangian and
    Hamiltonian formalism via the Legendre transform. Discuss conserved
    quantities and the least action principle in the Language of
    Hamiltonian mechanics.

-   Solve the equations of motion for a charged particle in an
    electromagnetic field using both Lagrangian and Hamiltonian
    formulation of mechanics.

-   What are Poisson properties? State their basic properties and
    discuss, with examples, their role in Hamiltonian mechanics.
