## Special Theory of Relativity

-   Describe relativistic energy. Be sure to mention rest energy,
    kinetic energy, relativistic energy relation, and the
    energy-momentum four-vector.

-   Discuss the center of mass of a system of relativistic particles.
    State and derive the formula for the speed of the center of mass in
    a laboratory frame, and show how the formula agrees with the
    classical limit at low speeds.

-   Discuss the space-time invariance of relativistic quantities. Be
    sure to mention the dot product of four vectors and the specific
    case of the energy-momentum four vector.

-   Describe the dynamics of a charged relativistic particle in a
    uniform electric field and in a uniform magnetic field. Describe
    both the classical and relativistic graphs of particle speed and
    displacement as functions of time.

## Semiclassical Quantum Physics

-   What is the Compton effect and why can't it be explained with
    classical physics? State and derive the expression for wavelength
    shift in the Compton effect.

-   Discuss X-ray spectra in the context of early quantum physics:
    explain the shape of both the continuous and discrete components of
    the X-ray spectrum; state and derive the minimum wavelength in
    *bremsstrahlung* radiation; what is the expression for the
    wavelength of the first K-alpha line?

## Quantum Mechanics in One Dimension

-   Discuss the orthnormalization of a quantum particle's energy
    eigenfunctions.

-   Discuss linear combinations of eigenfunctions and the concept of
    expanding a particle's wave function in terms of its energy
    eigenfunctions? Explain the process of computing the coefficients of
    individual eigenfunctions in the wave function's eigenfunction
    expansion.

-   Describe the problem of a quantum particle in an infinite potential
    well and its relevance to modeling real-life systems. State and
    derive the particle's energy eigenfunctions and eigenvalues; why do
    the eigenfunctions have the form they do?

-   Describe the problem of a quantum harmonic oscillator and its
    relevance to modeling real-life systems. Summarize the functional
    form of the oscillator's energy eigenfunctions (no derivation
    needed) and provide graphs of the first few eigenfunctions. What is
    the expression for a quantum harmonic oscillator's energy
    eigenvalues? Discuss the correspondence principle and the behavior
    of a quantum harmonic oscillator in the classical limit.

-   Describe the problem of an initially-free particle scattering from a
    finite potential step. What is the usual ansatz for the particle's
    wave function? Discuss probability current density and its
    application to the scattering problem.

## Atoms and Molecules

-   What are electron dipole transitions? Discuss the characteristic
    time in dipole transitions, and give an example calculation for
    transition times in a infinite potential well.

-   What is spin-orbit coupling and why/how does it occur? What is total
    angular momentum and how is it relevant in the context of spin-orbit
    coupling? Derive and discuss the splitting of atomic energy levels
    because of spin-orbit coupling.

-   Describe vibrational energy transitions in molecules.

-   Discus rotational energy in molecules: describe rotational energy
    transitions, sketch a typical rotational energy spectrum, and
    explain the presence of energy gaps in vibrational absorption
    spectra.

-   What is the Van der Waals interaction in molecules? Describe the
    role of electric dipoles in the Van der Waals interaction.
